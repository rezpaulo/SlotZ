# SlotZ
ESC - For slotcars BLHeli based

Project still under development.

This is a firmware based on BLHeli_S for MCU EFM8BB2, modified for brushless slotcars

Unnecessary load routines have been removed, so there is no delay in the motor start.
DSHOT programming is not supported.

It has not been tested on the track yet.
